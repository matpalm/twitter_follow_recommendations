bash> mkdir cache
OR symlink to cache used by tgraph

bash> export UID_PWD=twitter_uid:password

bash> ruby collect.rb YOUR_TWITTER_NUMERICAL_ID
let run until bored and ctrl-c

# reparse result for recommendation

bash> rm sum_sorted
bash> pig -x local -f aggregate_ratings.pig
bash> cat sum_sorted | ./insert_name.rb
